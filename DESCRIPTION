Description: The cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart is considered to be an alternative or complementary to Shewhart control charts in statistical process control (SPC) applications, owing to its higher sensitivity to small shifts in the process mean. It utilizes all the available data rather than the last few ones used in Shewhart control charts for quick decision making. V-mask is a traditional technique for separating meaningful data from unusual circumstances in a Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control chart; for see details about v-mask see Montgomery (1985, ISBN:978-0471656319). The mask is a V-shaped overlay placed on the CUSUM chart so that one arm of the V lines up with the slope of data points, making it easy to see data points that lie outside the slope and to determine whether these points should be discarded as random events, or treated as a performance trend that should be addressed. But, complex computations is one disadvantage V-mask method for detect small changes in mean using CUSUM control chart. Package 'vMask' can help to the applied users to overcome this challenge by considering six different methods which each of them are based on different information.
